# Node Voice Agent Starter

Start building interactive voice experiences with Deepgram's Voice Agent API using this Node.js starter application. This project demonstrates how to create a voice agent that can engage in natural conversations using Deepgram's advanced AI capabilities.

## What is Deepgram?

[Deepgram's](https://deepgram.com/) voice AI platform provides APIs for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and full speech-to-speech voice agents. Over 200,000+ developers use Deepgram to build voice AI products and features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js 18 or higher installed
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A Deepgram API key (see below)
- Audio files in supported formats (WAV, MP3, M4A, or FLAC)
